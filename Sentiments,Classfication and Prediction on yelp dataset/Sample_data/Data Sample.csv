He then assured me that the contract that I signed would be copied and sent to me. This never happened so I could not have known that the windows were not going to be replicas and upon discovering this I made numerous phone calls that were not returned until finally ED called me back and listened to my issues and then never returned my call again. I sent an email to corporate and they never called me or emailed me. I have more windows to replace but will never deal with these people again. Don't do it!!!!! If they tell you something you are assured it won't happen or it is a lie.

But they have major problems with their online ordering system. First they have two websites and two delivery systems. One is through beyond menu and the other through toast tab. The beyond menu online menu is not complete. You can't order everything such as making your own calzone. The toast tab menu is confusing and every time we've ordered the calzone we get a pizza delivered. Apparently the restaurant receives the order as a pizza. We've notified them of this problem and it hasn't been fixed. Today when we ordered we put a note in the special instructions to please make this a calzone! The delivery person said it was good that we wrote that because they were going to make us a pizza. They did however still screw up our order by giving us sausage instead of mushrooms. The only reason we're not super upset is that the pizza is really good. I really hope they fix their online ordering system because I'd like to continue to order from here!

He said the pizza was terrific and that they delivered.

I called BOGO and asked if they'd deliver to near Shaker Square. They got my zip code asked me to hold the line while they checked and then told me that my address was in the delivery area. I ordered a large Meat Works and a Bianco, both on traditional crust. He said delivery would be in 45 to 60 minutes and I set a timer to see how long it actually would take. The pizzas arrived in 30 minutes. 

The smell was tantalizing and the taste of each one was over the top. My wife declared that these were to two best pizzas in Cleveland and we weren't going anywhere else in the future.

The first thing we were concerned about was tequila: how can we can the most possible asap. Zocalo offers pitchers of Margaritas in all different flavors, ranging from 28$ to 60$ depending on the brand of tequila, flavor etc. We went with a frozen pitcher, and our waiter who was super cool let us mix the mango and strawberry flavors together. It was SO good, arguably the best frozen marg I've ever had. 

They give you complimentary chips and salsa, which were really good. The salsa didn't have too much cilantro in it, which I appreciate. The waiter also recommended the queso (not telling us it was another 4$) and it was SO GOOD. It was a white queso, really thick and creamy. I got the steak quesadilla as an entrée and was pleased.

They don't let you take videos, however I did because I couldn't resist.

The surrounding neighborhood, literally meaning the houses next door are not nice and the neighborhood looks a bit run down. I know there is a lot of crime in the area, so we made a quick pitstop on our way to see Lebron.

Food was not overly delayed, but there was little attention to water refills and request for more bread. I hope they can ramp up their coverage to match the popularity of this new establishment. We'll come back soon and maybe have a chance to try something from the dessert menu!",Molto Bene Italian Eatery,Lakewood,4.5,1,OH,Dennis,,3.9,1,NA

My wife and I have been here twice now for dinner and were quite pleased with the food and the clean, friendly atmosphere.
Format is that you order your food at the counter, pay, and get an order number to place on your table centerpiece. You get your own beverages at the service counter. Food is brought out to you when it's ready.
Not quite sure how to tip when the service is somewhat minimal, and adding a tip when you pay before dining doesn't seem quite right.
Food was excellent, if a bit pricey. We had Mac & cheese with pulled pork (wonderful) and a nicely done salmon entree on our first visit, and our second visit this afternoon was for a Thai peanut rice bowl (chicken, roasted red peppers, broccoli, carrots, pineapple, peanut sauce) and Mediterranean rice bowl (chicken, cucumber, hummus, olives, chick peas, tahini). Not a bad choice yet... so far, the Mac&Cheese with pulled pork is my favorite
We'll be back, and look forward to checking out breakfast fare once it's available.",Landmark,Cleveland,4.5,1,OH,Dennis,,3.9,1,NA

Arrived about 7:30 on a Friday evening and was pleased that the restaurant had more of a crowd, hoping they'll continue to thrive a bit off the main drag here in the Ohio City area.
Chive pancakes, pot stickers and calamari appetizers shared and enjoyed.  For entrees our group had hot crispy fried duck, pad Thai, papaya salad, and beef pepper satay, delicious!   Service was fine, all food brought out in a timely fashion, very personable server, no problems.

Started with the steam buns (vegan, philly, Kung Pao Chicken) and ginger margaritas (tea for me), all quite tasty. Picked our entrees from the Noodle Bowl list: Pad thai, Pho, and Jasmine with Tofu. Have been here three times now and never disappointed with the eclectic fusion food or service. Our server Alyssa was personable, knowledgable, and kept checking back all thru our meal to refill beverages/water and get anything else we needed.

My wife and I enjoyed some wonderful appetizers, eggplant, vegetables in red sauce, very tasty hummus and tabouleh, and great pita. For our entrees we had lamb, rice, corn and the delicious red cabbage salad. Got to sample two sauces, a green hot sauce with a nice burn and a nice white garlic sauce. Filled up and extra to take home. We've found our new go-to Middle Eastern/Greek restaurant. Planning on having felafel and dolmades on our next visit.

The restaurant is very nicely laid out with two dining rooms, plenty of tables, and a carpeted area with pillows for those so inclined. Also, wall artworks are tasteful and appropriate to the atmosphere.",Ohio Kabob Grill,Cleveland,4.5,1,OH,Dennis,,3.9,1,NA

Very pleasantly surprised at getting a great 14"" thin crust pizza with unlimited toppings for $15.99, ready for pickup 20 minutes after I called.
They just opened a couple of weeks ago, located in a small storefront on St Charles just south of Detroit (behind Panera and Beltone outlet). Small menu, three pizza sizes with choice of over a dozen toppings, four kinds of 8"" sub sandwiches, and soda. Menu cites Stromboli on the top, but they haven't worked that one out yet given their current baking equipment.

Lots of specials listed on the board in the entrance hallway, so check that before you take your table. Aldo's is very small, seating for maybe 25-30 max, and they don't take reservations, so I called before we left to make sure we wouldn't be waiting a long time for a table (arrived 7:15 on a Sunday evening)
Very good service staff, not too noisy, and excellent food prepared without any major delays. My wife had baked halibut on a bed of spinach, and I had truffle pasta with truffle oil, both good sized portions and delicious.
